Imagine your heart is a neural network… 💔🧠

Input layer: Your feelings 😢💌

Hidden layers: All the confusing thoughts and overthinking 🤯🌀

Activation functions: Trying to “activate” hope, but mostly just sigmoid of sadness 😬📉

Dropout layer: Some friends leave you alone when you need them most 😭🚪

Loss function: Measures how much your heart hurts 💔📊

Optimizer: You, trying to fix yourself with pizza, memes, and random life hacks 🍕😂🛠️

Epochs: Days passing… each one you think you’re better but somehow the loss keeps going up ⏳📈

Batch size: How many heartbreaks you can process at once 😭×32

And after all this… you realize:

Even if the network eventually converges, your love weights are still initialized randomly 😅💔🖤
